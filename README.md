Git Assignment
| Word      | Definition |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Branch | Branch is called for a new/separate version of the main repository. Branching in Git helps that one can work on implementing a particular feature or resolving a bug and not worry about changing the code permanently. |
| Checkout | Checkout navigates between different branches in a Git repository. |
| Commit | It is a sort of confirmation from your side. This command is used to save your changes to the local repository. |
| Fast-forward | Fast-forward is a kind of merge when there is a direct linear path from the source branch, instead of creating a new commit, git will just point master to the latest commit of the feature branch.There won't be any "merge commit" in fast-forwarding merge. |
| Fetch | Fetch command downloads all branches, tags, and data from a project to bring a local repository up to date with a remote repository but it doesn't merge any of those new data into your working files. |
| Head | Head points out the last commit in the current checkout branch. It is like a pointer to any reference. |
| Merge | Merge is a command that allows you to integrate changes from branches into a single branch. |
| Remote |Remote refers to another copy of the repository that is usually hosted on a remote server. |
| Origin | Origin is referred to the remote repository that a project was originally cloned from and where you want to publish your commits. |
| Up/Down-stream | Upstream and downstream are relative terms that can be used to describe the flow of data between two repositories. A repository that pulls or clones from another repository is called downstream to the other repository. The repository to which we push changes is called the upstream. Upstream repositories are usually central remote repositories to which all the collaborators contribute. |
| Pull | Pull is used to download content from a remote repository and update the local repository to match that content. |
| Push | Push is used to upload the commits from local repository content to a remote repository. |
| Repository | Git repository is a directory or storage space of the project that stores all the data.|
| Stash | Stash allows you to temporarily save your file changes without committing them to the repository. |



| clone | This creates a local copy of the remote repo. This allows you to make all of your edits locally rather than directly in the source files of the origin|
| rebase | The process of moving or combining a sequence of commits to a new base commit. Rebasing is most useful and easily visualized in the context of a feature branching workflow |
| Cherry picking | It enables arbitrary Git commits to be picked by reference and appended to the current working HEAD. Cherry picking is the act of picking a commit from a branch and applying it to another|
